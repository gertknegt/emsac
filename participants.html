            <h3>Aalto University</h3>
            <p>Aalto University as its current state is very young university but the roots of the three universities originally forming Aalto are deep in the history of Finland. The maritime department of Aalto has been strongly involved in the development of Finnish shipbuilding competence during decades with the co-operation between VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and also the industry. Naval Architecture students in Aalto have always been prioritising to keep good relations with Finnish shipyards and other companies, so building some new bridges across national borders is nothing but natural.</p>
            <p>We need to keep in mind the state of the economy and the unknown of the future as we are facing ever greater challenge as shipbuilders from the east now and in the future. We need to focus on what’s important, and that is to work together especially between the European countries, to ultimately build better ships for everybody!</p>
            <p>Finland has unique know-how when it comes to ice-breaking because of the harsh winters, but also when it comes to building the world’s biggest cruise ships for the Caribbean. Other countries have developed more some different areas of competence and it’s nice to get to hear from others’ experiences and also to share ideas and good time with nice people! Delft also seems a very nice city from the google with all the canals, so we are expecting to have a quite awesome time there.</p>

            <h3>Schiffbau goes Delft</h3>
            <p>We are the German delegation consisting of three students from Duisburg and nine students from Hamburg. In preparation of the trip to Delft we would like to introduce the motivation for our participation at EMSAC 2013.</p>
            <p>Our first reason is you! We are excited that we get the opportunity to meet the Delft naval architecture students and see the University of Delft. On your last visit to Hamburg you left us with lots of your ,I love SCHEEPSBOUW‘ sticker in lots of different possible and not so possible places. We are excited to get a chance for a revenge and show you our new ,schiffbauer‘ sticker.</p>
            <p>In 2010 we went on a two day excursion visiting the maritime industry in the region of Vlissingen and Wageningen. With all the good impressions of this journey in mind, we cannot wait to learn and see more of the Netherlands way of maritime business.</p>
            <p>We also see a great cultural aspect in this Conference. On the one hand we are excited to see the city of Delft and Amsterdam and on the other hand we are looking forward to meet naval architecture students from all over Europe.</p>
            <p>We would also like to use this Conference to revive the old contacts between the Hamburg student association “Heylige Frawe Latte ad Hammaburg”, the Duisburg “Schiffbauerzunft Metazentrum”  and the Delft “Scheepsbouwkundig Gezelschap William Froude”. We are certain that we will have a great time together and we are now counting the days till the 5th of June.</p>

            <h4>Admiral Makarov State University of Maritime and Inland Shipping</h4>
            <p>The scenic beauty of the Netherlands has always instilled in me a desire to one day visit there. The Netherlands has been recognized as the knowledge center of long study traditions and well-known universities. Due to its central position, the Netherlands has been described as the Gateway to Europe and its key position in the new European Union and multinational market.</p>
            <p>As a student of Marine engineering from the Admiral Makarov State University of Maritime and Inland Shipping (AMSUMIS), the EMSAC ‘13, I believe would be the opportunity of a lifetime for me and my colleagues to thoroughly contemplate the real width and depth of our field. Netherlands, having centuries old heritage of maritime operations, would definitely be the apt place to understand and appreciate the age old and perfected techniques in marine engineering.</p>
            <p>Going through the programme brochure of EMSAC ’13, we are extremely excited and looking forward to the lineup of brilliantly molded events and titillating activities that will more than inspire us and further propel us in our career endeavors. Moreover, the exposure we get from the various interactions during the conference with students and faculty from all over Europe, would I believe, help in our intellectual and cognitive development. Keeping apart the academic side, we sincerely hope to forge strong bonds of friendship with our fellow attendees and we’re really looking forward to the various social events that the EMSAC is organizing.</p>

            <h3>Why SUNAS is going to EMSAC</h3>
            <p>The Strathclyde University Naval Architecture society (SUNAS) is just turning three years old, compared to the Froude society, we knew that we had a lot to learn! SUNAS has been in contact with the Froude society over the past few years learning how a larger and older society runs things, and they helped us set up our constitution. Therefore we were eager to visit Holland anyway, and the EMSAC conference has provided an ideal opportunity for us. I especially want to pick the brains of the Froude committee to learn all I can from them.</p>
            <p>I am a great believer in making connections to help each other, and the chance to meet people from all over Europe face to face doesn’t happen every day! Though we are a Scottish University, the members going to Delft range from all over the world and are eager to mingle with others.</p>
            <p>The majority of us have also never been to Holland, and so we are looking forward to experiencing Dutch culture and hospitality in the Amsterdam trip and staying with host families.</p>
            <p>The program that was sent out to us really caught our interest, as though our area is steeped in naval history, there is not much industry left in the present day in Glasgow; the industry trip and business fair will be great!</p>
            <p>All in all, the members of SUNAS are really up for going on this trip, to see Holland, to experience the industry, and to meet up with other students from all around Europe.</p>

            <h3>Istanbul Technical University</h3>
            <p>located in Istanbul, Turkey,  is the world's third oldest technical university of  engineering sciences as well as social sciences recently, and is one of the most prominent educational institutions in Turkey. It has 39 undergraduate, 144 graduate programs, 13 colleges, 346 labs and 12 research centers.</p>
            <p>ITU’s distinguished history began in 1773. It was founded by Sultan Mustafa III as the Imperial School of Naval Engineering. In 1795 the school started to train technical military staff for the modernization of the Ottoman army. In 1845, school’s function was further widened with the addition of architecture program. The scope and name of the school were extended and changed again in 1883 and in 1909. It became a public engineering school aiming to train civil engineers for the rapidly developing country.</p>
            <p>By 1928 the institution had gained formal recognition as a university of engineering and architecture. In 1944 the name was changed to Istanbul Technical University and it became an autonomous university.</p>
            <p>With its long history of 234 years, its modern teaching environment, and well-qualified teaching staff, ITU today is the personification of the engineering and architectural education in Turkey. ITU not only played a leading role in the modernization movement of the empire, but has also maintained its leadership position in the innovations taking place in the construction, industrialization, and technology during the modern days of the Turkish Republic. Engineers and architects trained at ITU have played significant roles in the construction of Turkey and Turkish politics.</p>
