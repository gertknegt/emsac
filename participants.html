            <h3>Schiffbau goes Delft</h3>
            <p>We are the German delegation consisting of three students from Duisburg and nine students from Hamburg. In preparation of the trip to Delft we would like to introduce the motivation for our participation at EMSAC 2013.</p>
            <p>Our first reason is you! We are excited that we get the opportunity to meet the Delft naval architecture students and see the University of Delft. On your last visit to Hamburg you left us with lots of your ,I love SCHEEPSBOUW‘ sticker in lots of different possible and not so possible places. We are excited to get a chance for a revenge and show you our new ,schiffbauer‘ sticker.</p>
            <p>In 2010 we went on a two day excursion visiting the maritime industry in the region of Vlissingen and Wageningen. With all the good impressions of this journey in mind, we cannot wait to learn and see more of the Netherlands way of maritime business.</p>
            <p>We also see a great cultural aspect in this Conference. On the one hand we are excited to see the city of Delft and Amsterdam and on the other hand we are looking forward to meet naval architecture students from all over Europe.</p>
            <p>We would also like to use this Conference to revive the old contacts between the Hamburg student association “Heylige Frawe Latte ad Hammaburg”, the Duisburg “Schiffbauerzunft Metazentrum”  and the Delft “Scheepsbouwkundig Gezelschap William Froude”. We are certain that we will have a great time together and we are now counting the days till the 5th of June.</p>

            <h4>Admiral Makarov State University of Maritime and Inland Shipping</h4>
            <p>The scenic beauty of the Netherlands has always instilled in me a desire to one day visit there. The Netherlands has been recognized as the knowledge center of long study traditions and well-known universities. Due to its central position, the Netherlands has been described as the Gateway to Europe and its key position in the new European Union and multinational market.</p>
            <p>As a student of Marine engineering from the Admiral Makarov State University of Maritime and Inland Shipping (AMSUMIS), the EMSAC ‘13, I believe would be the opportunity of a lifetime for me and my colleagues to thoroughly contemplate the real width and depth of our field. Netherlands, having centuries old heritage of maritime operations, would definitely be the apt place to understand and appreciate the age old and perfected techniques in marine engineering.</p>
            <p>Going through the programme brochure of EMSAC ’13, we are extremely excited and looking forward to the lineup of brilliantly molded events and titillating activities that will more than inspire us and further propel us in our career endeavors. Moreover, the exposure we get from the various interactions during the conference with students and faculty from all over Europe, would I believe, help in our intellectual and cognitive development. Keeping apart the academic side, we sincerely hope to forge strong bonds of friendship with our fellow attendees and we’re really looking forward to the various social events that the EMSAC is organizing.</p>

            <h3>Why SUNAS is going to EMSAC</h3>
            <p>The Strathclyde University Naval Architecture society (SUNAS) is just turning three years old, compared to the Froude society, we knew that we had a lot to learn! SUNAS has been in contact with the Froude society over the past few years learning how a larger and older society runs things, and they helped us set up our constitution. Therefore we were eager to visit Holland anyway, and the EMSAC conference has provided an ideal opportunity for us. I especially want to pick the brains of the Froude committee to learn all I can from them.</p>
            <p>I am a great believer in making connections to help each other, and the chance to meet people from all over Europe face to face doesn’t happen every day! Though we are a Scottish University, the members going to Delft range from all over the world and are eager to mingle with others.</p>
            <p>The majority of us have also never been to Holland, and so we are looking forward to experiencing Dutch culture and hospitality in the Amsterdam trip and staying with host families.</p>
            <p>The program that was sent out to us really caught our interest, as though our area is steeped in naval history, there is not much industry left in the present day in Glasgow; the industry trip and business fair will be great!</p>
            <p>All in all, the members of SUNAS are really up for going on this trip, to see Holland, to experience the industry, and to meet up with other students from all around Europe.</p>
